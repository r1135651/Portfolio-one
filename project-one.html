				<h3>Problems</h3>

				<h4>Website Evaluation: Where TLED is now</h4>
				<p>The Teaching and Learning Excellence Department (TLED) at Austin Community College (ACC) asked us to evaluate it's website before its release (6 week time frame). They particularly wanted to know if content could easily discovered within their website by their main user: ACC faculty.</p>

				<h4>Generative Research: New Opportunities</h4>
				<p>TLED also wanted us to interview faculty to determine their current needs and generate new ideas to address these.</p>

					<h4>The Team</h4>

					<ul>
						<li>Richard Stafford</li>
						<li>Helen Elliot</li>
						<li>Anughna (Anu) Kandimalla</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Planning</h4>

					<p>Initially we wanted to get a shared understanding with our stakeholder of the outcomes, scope, time-frame and schedule of the project so we developed a project plan. This also allowed us to clearly establish responsibility and roles wihtin the team.</p>

					<blockquote class="project-blockquote">We had a great plan but it ended up being ignored: it should have been a <strong>living document updated, adapted and growing as our project developed!</strong></blockquote>

					<p>First Helen and I established the goals of our generative research interviews. We did this by talking to our stakeholder. We wrote questions and then analyzed them to determine whether they would allow participants to tell their stories of what is like to be an ACC professor. Our interviews focused on finding out what their life is like as college professors. I conducted 4 generative interviews.</p>

					<h4>Stakeholder Priorities Changed!</h4>

					<p>Our stakeholders had a change of circumstances and they needed to have our evaluative research 4 weeks earlier than scheduled. We quickly reorganized to all focus on the webiste evaluation. Anu had already created the evaluation test evaluation script. Anu and I conducted 6 evaulative user tests to determine whether the new TLED website would be functional for the facutly users. Helen conducted a heuristic analysis of the new website.</p>

					<p>In order to make sense of our evaluative data to determine the usability of the new TLED website we used the rainbow analysis method to clearly highlight success/failure of tasks. Seeing the data together allowed us to determine the frequency and severity of user problems with the new website design.</p>

					<p>Taking this evaluative research we combined it with our initial generative research and created a presentation to clearly communicate successful and problem areas in the new website. Then basing our recommendations on gernerative user concerns we communicated further opportunities for TLED to help professors be more successful</p>
